      <h2>Brandon Holcombe, AIA</h2>
      <h3>Principal Architect</h3>
      <p><strong>Education:</strong> Bachelor's of Architecture, Virginia Tech</p>
      <p>
        Brandon Holcombe, a Delaware native, discovered his passion for architecture at an early age, drawn to the unique combination of creativity and problem-solving. After earning his degree from Virginia Tech in 2016, he honed his skills while working in Nashville, Tennessee, where he contributed to a diverse range of projects spanning medical / dental facilities, multi-family developments, educational institutions, industrial buildings, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2019, Brandon relocated to Henrico County, Virginia, where he worked remotely for two years, which helped refine his communication and project management skills. He joined Cornerstone Architects in 2021, where he further developed his project management expertise, leading complex projects with precision and a client-focused approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2024, Brandon founded River's Edge Architects, PLLC, with a clear mission: to guide clients in turning their visions into reality while contributing to the growth and vitality of his community through thoughtful, sustainable design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brandon also understands and emphasizes the importance of a work-life balance. When he's not at the office, he enjoys quality time with his wife, his son, and their two dogs. An avid golfer, boater, and baseball fan, he relishes the opportunity to embrace the outdoors, whether he's on the golf course, on the river, or at the ballpark.
